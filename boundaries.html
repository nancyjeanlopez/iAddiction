        Alutaybi and his team categorized proactive measures for establishing internet boundaries into three different protocol types: unilateral, bilateral/reciprocal, and collective. The individual user creates unilateral protocols. These measures
        involve setting a limit on daily social
        media usage. Several applications are available for both computers and smartphones that will deny access to SNSs once the user has reached their predetermined daily limit. It is up to the user to stick to this limit through
        self-governance and time-management. Bilateral protocols involve the user and the individuals they interact with through Internet-communication applications. Users come to a mutual understanding about limiting their online interactions (i.e.,
        "I won't respond to messages during mealtimes and after 10 pm."). Setting these boundaries will help users reduce FoMO because they won't be waiting anxiously for the other party to respond. Collective protocols are established between group
        members who agree on boundaries that benefit the entire group. For example, if a study group meets in the library at the same time every week, the group can agree that they will be unavailable to respond to messages during study time
        ("Designing Social Networks..." 4). By
        establishing protocols to combat FoMO and spreading awareness of IA among their peers, some users can begin to wean themselves away from SNSs and communication applications. In combination with CBT and pharmacological interventions, these
        solutions seem promising for people suffering from IA.
