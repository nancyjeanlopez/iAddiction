      <h4>What is Internet Addiction?</h4>

      <p class="rightpquote">"...The inability to inhibit Internet use that exerts an adverse impact on major life domains..."</p>

      <p>A 2008 study from the University of Iowa's Department of Psychiatry defined <a href="glossary.html#link1">Internet Addiction</a> (IA) as "excessive or poorly controlled preoccupations, urges or behaviors regarding computer use and inter
        access that lead to impairment or distress." </p>

      <p>This vague definition has remained nearly unchanged over the last 12 years due to a lack of research. A telephone survey at the time reported that 0.3-0.7% of the US population had this condition (Shaw and Black 353). A 2014 study from the
        University of Hong Kong updated those numbers, increasing IA's prevalence rate to 8% (Cheng and Li 758). The Hong Kong study defined IA as "the inability to inhibit Internet use that exerts an adverse impact on major life domains (e.g.,
        interpersonal relations, physical health)."</p>

      <p class="leftpquote"> "...Impaired control over one's ability to curb the duration and frequency of online activities..."</p>

      <p> In 2013, the World Health Organization acknowledged Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) as the first addictive behavior disorder not related to substance abuse stipulating that the topic needed more research. However, the condition was not
        officially recognized as a disorder until the publication of the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision, in 2018 (Wolfling et al. 1019).</p>

      <p> Over the last decade, the concept of IA has expanded to include IGD and other addictive online activities. More recent definitions now include "the use of social network services, such as chats; surfing sites providing pornographic
        material; participation in gambling; collecting as well as streaming videos or movies, excessive shopping; or aimless gathering or searching for information." <a href="glossary.html#link3">Maladaptive behavioral responses</a> to IA include
        impaired control over one's ability to curb the duration and frequency of online activities, prioritizing online activities over daily responsibilities, and the escalation of activities despite the adverse effects to one's health and personal
        relationships (1019). Patients who suffer from IA also exhibit <a href="glossary.html#link4">comorbidity</a> symptoms and traits like depression, anxiety, introversion, low social competencies, and frustration (Shaw and Black 358-9; Wegmann
        40; Hadlington 9). <a href="glossary.html#link2">The Fear of Missing Out (FoMO)</a> is another condition under the IA's broad umbrella that entails the compulsive checking and refreshing of social media feeds.</p>
      <p>This website was created to help increase awareness of IA as well as explore its causes, susceptible personality types, and possible treatment options.
