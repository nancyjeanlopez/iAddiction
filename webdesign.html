      <h4>Combatting Persuasive Web Design</h4>
      <p>
        SNS developers rely on persuasive web design principles to increase the time spent on their platforms. The ability to increase the time users spend online is an online marketing principle that translates to higher ad revenue for the platform
        developers. Persuasive design features like time-sensitive "stories" and "feeds" create a sense of scarcity in the user's reasoning; they must log in regularly, or they might miss something important. As a result, they spend more time
        checking and refreshing their social media feeds and are exposed to more advertisements. Other design elements like "presence" tell users when their friends are online and what they are viewing. These surveillance-type features activate
        feelings of <a href="glossary.html#link2">FoMO</a> and frustration; users can see that their friends are online but they are not responding to them ("How Can Social Networks..." 3761). These features also contribute to increased levels of
        anxiety, depression, isolation, and worthlessness.

        In a study by Alutaybi and his colleagues, researchers considered how to combat IA—specifically, the FoMO associated with SNS features—by adding counter-features that help users manage their social media feeds more effectively. Embedding a
        filter feature is solution developers can use to help users tackle FoMO, according to the study. A filter system would allow users to prioritize the information they missed since their last visit. Alutaybi also suggests a notification
        hierarchy with various pre-set tones. Audible cues will let users know which notifications are important and which ones they can ignore. Users who worry about their online impressions (the number of "likes" or comments one received on an SNS
        post) reported that this is a great source of anxiety for them. "It's been more than 5-6 hours since I uploaded my last post, but until now, my friends haven't liked it or commented on it. I cannot figure out if they are ignoring me or they
        are busy," one study participant stated. Researchers suggest a status tracker or availability calendar that allows users to see when their friends are online. This feature would help reduce anxiety over impressions and help users make better
        use of their own time instead of constantly checking for their friend's feedback ("Designing Social Networks…" 4).
